-moving back and forth after rotating is weird
fix:
	- something with move_x and move_y, player->angle in player_movement.c

-textures get distorted when coming to close to the wall, now it looks like the thing goes a bit into the wall.
fix:
	- only go up to the wall, eyes can touch, thats it

-not optimized
fix:
	- optimize so no place on the screen is drawn more times than one, ceiling & floor only needs to be rendered once


Hello this is a cute way to communicate what do you want me to do ?:DD

<3333
hello partner

todo monday:

-textures get distorted when coming to close to the wall, now it looks like the thing goes a bit into the wall.
fix:
	- only go up to the wall, eyes can touch, thats it, or implement some sort of scale in the render wall_slice, or a stop, so the player cant go closer

- see if there are structs that can be reused

- extensive map_testing
	- ruben said he has a lot of test, otherwise just some repo on github

- double check all leaks, now after norminette

- final norminette, delete comments and stuff
