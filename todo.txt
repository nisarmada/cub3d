-moving back and forth after rotating is weird
fix:
	- something with move_x and move_y, player->angle in player_movement.c

-textures get distorted when coming to close to the wall, now it looks like the thing goes a bit into the wall.
fix:
	- only go up to the wall, eyes can touch, thats it

-program gets slower when running it for a longer time
fix:
	- look if memory is allocated while running the program, if so --> change so it doesnt
	- optimize so no place on the screen is drawn more times than one
