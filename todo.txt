-moving back and forth after rotating is weird
fix:
	- something with move_x and move_y, player->angle in player_movement.c

-textures get distorted when coming to close to the wall, now it looks like the thing goes a bit into the wall.
fix:
	- only go up to the wall, eyes can touch, thats it

-not optimized
fix:
	- optimize so no place on the screen is drawn more times than one, ceiling & floor only needs to be rendered once
